## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
This project was developed by myself and Pranay Begwani during our time at Pate's Grammar School as the Co-Founders of Computer Science Society. We developed the website as a fun way to revise and to practice our HTML + CSS. The project is made purely with HTML and CSS.
